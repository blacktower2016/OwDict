# OwDict
One word dictionary project (Python training)

This is my Python training project.
Main idea: 
--- It is the one word dictionary.

The script takes english word as a parameter and  finds russian translation.
At first it looks up in the local dictionary file, and then if this attempt fails, in the online dictionary.
Script takes only first meaning from the online base.
